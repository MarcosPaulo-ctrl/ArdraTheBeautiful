                            Use a <strong class="underline_skills">bonus action</strong> on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one <strong class="underline_skills">Bardic Inspiration</strong> die, a d6. Once within the next <strong class="underline_skills">10 minutes</strong>, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one <strong class="underline_skills">ability check, attack roll, or saving throw</strong> it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. On <strong class="underline_skills">level 5</strong> it becomes a <strong class="underline_skills">d8</strong>, on <strong class="underline_skills">level 10</strong> it becomes a <strong class="underline_skills">d10</strong>, and a <strong class="underline_skills">d12</strong> at <strong class="underline_skills">level 15</strong>

You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.
